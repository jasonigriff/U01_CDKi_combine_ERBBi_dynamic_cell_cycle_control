# U01_CDKi_combine_ERBBi_dynamic_cell_cycle_control
This repository contains code accompanying the project: "Combination CDK4/6 and ErbB inhibition induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ribociclib-resistant estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer". 

It provides code used to analyze the dynamic transcriptional RNA sequencing data of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant and -sensitive ER+ breast cell cell lines during individual or combined treatment with CDK4/6i (ribociclib) or ERBBi (afatinib).
